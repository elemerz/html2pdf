# Output directory where ZIP files and presence markers will be created
# Should match the zip.input-folder from invoice-parser

# === Randomness Configuration - COUNT ===

# Minimum number of ZIP files to generate per batch (inclusive)

# === Randomness Configuration - TIME DISTRIBUTION ===

# Minimum delay in milliseconds between batches (inclusive)
data-generator.delayMinMs=2000

# Maximum delay in milliseconds between batches (inclusive)
data-generator.delayMaxMs=10000

# Minimum delay in milliseconds between consecutive files WITHIN a batch (inclusive)
# This controls the pace of file generation within each batch

# Useful for simulating realistic arrival patterns (e.g., 100-500ms between files)

# Important: This ensures the ZIP is fully written before the marker appears

# Invoice types to randomly select from (comma-separated)
# These are valid invoice types supported by the system

# === Generation Mode ===
