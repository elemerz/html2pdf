- In `quill-editor` I add a piece of text, and using the `ql-font` dropdown I did set its
   font-family to "KIX Barcode".
   - I opened Chrome Developer Tools (F12) and inspected the underlying markup of the freshly
   inserted text. I got the following outerHTML of the inserion:
   ```
   <span style="font-family: &quot;KIX Barcode&quot;;">9999AA</span>
   ```
   Please observe the surrounding &quot; entities around the name of the font-family (and also an
   extraneous semicolon.
   Please change the code, so that instead of the surrounding &quot; entities, use the single
   apostrophe (') characters.

Feature request:
  - Current Situation: The SpringBean @/invoice-parser/src/main/java/nl/infomedics/invoicing/config/
  TemplateHtmlConfig.java loads all the xhtml templates from the classpath in a Map.
  -Desired improvement: Whenever any file in that `templates/for-pdf` changes => automatically reload
  the whole map. This way, I don't have to restart the server whenever a template changes!
