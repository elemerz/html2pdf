I’d like to select “n – 1” additional colors—each as visually distinct as possible—next to a given base color, using the following logic:

The Hue is treated as a full circle, and I locate the point corresponding to the given base color. This will be the so-called “reference point” on the Hue circle.

If n = 2:
One additional color must be selected beside the given base color.
Its Hue value corresponds to the diametrically opposite point of the base color’s Hue.
The other two parameters (Saturation and Brightness) are the same as those of the base color.

If n = 3:
Two additional colors must be selected beside the given base color.
Their Hue values correspond to the other two vertices of an equilateral triangle, where the first vertex represents the base color’s Hue.
The other two parameters (Saturation, Brightness) are identical to those of the base color.

If n = K:
(K – 1) colors must be selected beside the given base color.
Their Hue values correspond to the vertices of a regular K-sided polygon, where the first vertex represents the base color’s Hue.
The other two parameters (Saturation, Brightness) are identical to those of the base color.

Let’s now apply the rule with n = 5, meaning we need 4 additional colors.

Convert the base color (#446b88) from HEX to HSL:
HSL(206°, 34%, 40%)

To form a regular 5-gon on the Hue circle:
Each color’s hue is separated by 360 / 5 = 72°.

Thus, the five hues are:

206° (base color)

278° (206 + 72)

350° (278 + 72)

62° (350 + 72 → wraps around)

134° (62 + 72)

Keeping S = 34%, L = 40%, we get:

Color	HSL	Approx. HEX
Base	hsl(206, 34%, 40%)	#446b88
1	hsl(278, 34%, 40%)	#664488
2	hsl(350, 34%, 40%)	#884457
3	hsl(62, 34%, 40%)	#808844
4	hsl(134, 34%, 40%)	#44885d
