# PDF conversion concurrency control
# - Meaning: This property limits the number of concurrent batch requests that the invoice-parser service sends to the pdf-creator service.
# - Mechanism: It sets the size of the thread pool and semaphore in ZipIngestService. This means invoice-parser will process at most 8 ZIP 
#   files (specifically the PDF generation phase of them) simultaneously.
# - Role: It acts as a client-side throttle to prevent overwhelming the pdf-creator service or the network.
