- Current Situation:
 - I can drag a table component from the Toolbar to the canvas.
 - I also can visually select a cell in the table by clicking it with the mouse.
- New feature request:
 - When a cell gets selected show a floating "cell actions" toolbar above the selected cell, 
   containing an "edit content" (pencil) icon. Align the bottom of the toolbar with the top of the selected cell.
===============================
1-st improvement:
- Align the "cell actions" toolbar horizontally to the "middle" of the top border of the cell.
- I see the entered content being reflected in .property-textarea inside Element properties Pane. This Ok,
  but please reflect it inside the edited cell itself. Be sure to:
   - support HTML content as well.
   - preserve formatting (like white-space, newLine, etc)
===============================
2-nd improvement:
- The content now reflects inside the edited table cell, which is Ok.
- But: When I save the file (Menu/File/Save), open the downloaded file with Notepad++, I see only &nbsp; inside the cell,
  so the content I entered in the cell, is NOT saved together with the file!
===============================
3-rd Improvement:
- When saving the (X)HTML doxument, please strip ALL the following lines from the beginning of the document:
- <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
- <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
===============================
4-th Improvement:
In dropped a 2x2 table (4 cells) to the canvas. I entered in the 4 cells the following strings:
-Row1Col1: R1C1
-Row1Col2: R1C2
-Row2Col1: R2C1
-Row2Col2: R2C2
On the screen the information is correctly reflected in the appropriate cells of the dropped table, => Ok.
But: In the saved file, if I open it with Notepad++, I see the same R1C1 in all 4 cells!
=================================
Feature request: Support Cell padding and alignment:
Current Situation:
- When a Table cell is selected, it is "marked" by a blue-ish color, but on the right pane (Element Properties)
  Still the properties of the "parent table" are shown.
1-st Improvement request:
- When a Table cell is selected, the Properties Pane should display the selected cell-s own properties:
  - Padding: top, right, bottom, left (use small, compact number spinners. Default values:0mm)
  - The 4 "Padding" spinners set the Top/Right/Bottom/Left padding of the selected cell in millimeters.

- The 3 "H-Alignment"-buttons set the text-align: left/center/right of the selected cell.
- The 3 "V-Alignment"-buttons set the vertical-align: top/middle/bottom of the selected cell.
- Content alignments (text-align, vertical-align): use 2 rows of small square icons: 
- 1-st icon row for Horizontal alignments: Left, Center, Right
- 2-nd icon row for Vertical alignments: Top,Middle,Bottom
-For Content alignment buttons please use the ".ico-align_*" classes defined in: @src/app/styles/alignment-icons.less
=== Change Request: Eliminate Position: absolute ===
Why:
The produced XHTML will be processed by some rudimentary 3rd-party CSS2-engine (out of our control). This CSS2 engine
is generating PDF reports from our downloaded XHTML file. This CSS2-engine does not handle positioned elements correctly!
The requested Change:
- When placing elements to the canvas, we are NOT ALLOWED to use positioned elements anymore so, please change the 
  implementation in the following way:
- When an element (only Table for now, but we will support also others elements like <div> soon) is dropped to the 
  canvas, determine its placement as follows:
  - If it is the first element on the canvas: it can be placed whereever we want.
  - If there are already elements on the canvas: it must be "snapped" either "right-before", or "right-after" an 
    existing element, called ReferenceElement.
   - At the moment of "dropping", the distance between the new element and the reference element should be 0 by default,
     modifiable later via the "margin" properties (in property pane).
- Use only elements in the normal flow (position:static).
  Use margins for positioning.
